# VK-Scraper
This repo will contain various scripts to scrape the VK API using Colaboratory specifically. Requires GDrive to be attached but can be altered easily for different output.

--------

Requires VK access token, which unfortunately is hard to get with a non-RU phone #. But, conveniently, you can find many many many russian data analyst students that publish their projects from bootcamp and will show you exactly how and where to use your access token if and when you happen to maybe find one somewhere. If you sort a search on here by 'jupyter notebook' you will find sooo many great examples of where to use and how to input your access token. There are so many great examples.
